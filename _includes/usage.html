## Essential use

peep is a simple utility that reaches out to the web and pulls down 
scripted commands that you can use to generate groovy prompts.

The simplest way to do this is by using the shell and redirecting
the output into a file:

peep react-component > react-component.md

You can then edit this file to come up with the prompt of your dreams.
