## Using .env files

The easiest way to use peep is with .env files, which can be picked
up by your shell or your application as needed. A .env file is
not required, but it is a standard for holding environment variables
that your app needs for runtime or that you might need during 
development. 

You'll notice that a number of settings (such as Resource Group,
Application Name, Location, etc) are set using shell variables.
These variables are application-specific so setting them in a 
central location is generally a good idea.

If you're using Oh My Zsh! for zshell, you can install a .env plugin
that's very useful:
