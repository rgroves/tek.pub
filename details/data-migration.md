This template helps you plan and execute safe, reliable data migrations between databases, systems, or data formats. It covers migration strategies, validation procedures, and rollback planning.

## Sample Prompt

```
Plan a data migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL:
- Schema conversion and data type mapping
- ETL pipeline for data transformation and transfer
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Migration testing in staging environment
- Rollback procedures and contingency planning
- Minimal downtime strategy for production migration
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Migration planning** with timeline, dependencies, and risk assessment
- **Data transformation** and schema conversion strategies
- **ETL pipeline design** for efficient data transfer and processing
- **Validation procedures** to ensure data integrity and completeness
- **Testing strategies** including staging environment validation
- **Rollback planning** and contingency procedures for migration failures

## Best Practices

1. **Plan thoroughly** with detailed migration steps and timeline
2. **Test extensively** in staging environments before production migration
3. **Validate data integrity** at every step of the migration process
4. **Plan for rollback scenarios** with tested recovery procedures
5. **Minimize downtime** with incremental migration strategies when possible
6. **Monitor closely** during and after migration for issues
7. **Document everything** including procedures, results, and lessons learned
8. **Have a go/no-go decision process** based on validation criteria

## When to Use This Template

- Migrating between different database systems
- Upgrading database versions with schema changes
- Moving data between cloud providers or platforms
- Consolidating data from multiple sources
- Implementing new data storage architectures
