This template provides a framework for conducting comprehensive security audits of applications and infrastructure, including vulnerability assessment and compliance validation.

## Sample Prompt

```
Conduct security audit for a web application:
- Authentication and authorization mechanism review
- Input validation and SQL injection vulnerability testing
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) and CSRF protection analysis
- SSL/TLS configuration and certificate management audit
- Data encryption at rest and in transit verification
- Access control and privilege escalation testing
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Vulnerability assessment** including automated scanning and manual testing
- **Authentication security** with multi-factor authentication and session management
- **Authorization controls** including role-based access and privilege escalation
- **Data protection** covering encryption, data handling, and privacy compliance
- **Network security** including SSL/TLS configuration and firewall rules
- **Compliance validation** for industry standards and regulatory requirements

## Best Practices

1. **Use both automated tools and manual testing** for comprehensive coverage
2. **Follow established frameworks** like OWASP Top 10 or NIST guidelines
3. **Document all findings** with severity ratings and remediation recommendations
4. **Test in production-like environments** with realistic data and configurations
5. **Include social engineering** and physical security considerations
6. **Regular audit schedules** rather than one-time assessments
7. **Involve multiple team members** for diverse perspectives and expertise
8. **Track remediation progress** with clear timelines and responsibility assignments

## When to Use This Template

- Conducting regular security assessments for applications and infrastructure
- Preparing for compliance audits or regulatory requirements
- Investigating security incidents or breach responses
- Validating security improvements after implementing new controls
- Establishing security baselines for new applications or systems
