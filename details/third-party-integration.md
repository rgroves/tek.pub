This template guides you through implementing robust third-party service integrations, including API consumption, error handling, and data synchronization strategies.

## Sample Prompt

```
Integrate payment processing with Stripe API:
- Customer creation and payment method management
- Subscription billing with webhook handling for status updates
- Invoice generation and payment confirmation processing
- Error handling for failed payments and API rate limits
- Webhook security with signature verification
- Fallback procedures for service unavailability
```

## What This Template Covers

- **API integration patterns** including REST, GraphQL, and webhook consumption
- **Authentication strategies** for secure third-party service access
- **Error handling** and retry logic for unreliable external services
- **Data synchronization** between internal systems and external services
- **Rate limiting** and quota management for API usage optimization
- **Security considerations** including credential management and data protection

## Best Practices

1. **Implement proper error handling** with exponential backoff and circuit breakers
2. **Secure API credentials** using environment variables and secret management
3. **Validate webhook signatures** to ensure data integrity and security
4. **Log integration activities** for debugging and audit purposes
5. **Monitor API usage** and implement rate limiting to avoid quota exhaustion
6. **Test with sandbox environments** before production integration
7. **Plan for service unavailability** with graceful degradation strategies
8. **Document integration dependencies** and update procedures

## When to Use This Template

- Integrating payment processing, authentication, or communication services
- Connecting with SaaS platforms for CRM, marketing, or analytics
- Implementing data synchronization with external business systems
- Adding social media or messaging platform integrations
- Building applications that depend on external APIs or services
