This template helps you implement feature flags (feature toggles) to enable controlled feature rollouts, A/B testing, and safe deployment practices. It covers flag management, targeting strategies, and monitoring.

## Sample Prompt

```
Implement feature flags for a new checkout flow:
- Boolean flags for enabling/disabling the new checkout
- User targeting based on roles, regions, or percentage rollouts
- A/B testing infrastructure with experiment tracking
- Real-time flag updates without application deployment
- Analytics integration for measuring feature impact
- Cleanup strategy for removing obsolete flags
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Flag types and strategies** including boolean, multivariate, and percentage-based flags
- **User targeting** with sophisticated segmentation and rollout controls
- **Real-time updates** and flag management without code deployments
- **A/B testing integration** with experiment design and statistical analysis
- **Monitoring and analytics** for feature performance and user behavior
- **Flag lifecycle management** including creation, testing, and cleanup procedures

## Best Practices

1. **Start with simple boolean flags** before implementing complex targeting
2. **Use descriptive flag names** that clearly indicate the feature being controlled
3. **Implement flag fallbacks** to handle service outages gracefully
4. **Monitor flag performance** and impact on application metrics
5. **Clean up obsolete flags** regularly to avoid technical debt
6. **Test flag configurations** thoroughly in staging environments
7. **Document flag purposes** and expected behavior for team understanding
8. **Use gradual rollouts** to minimize risk when releasing new features

## When to Use This Template

- Implementing controlled feature rollouts and canary deployments
- Setting up A/B testing and experimentation frameworks
- Managing feature access for different user segments
- Reducing deployment risk with feature toggles
- Creating kill switches for quick feature disabling in emergencies
