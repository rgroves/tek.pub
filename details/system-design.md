This template helps you design large-scale distributed systems with proper architecture, scalability considerations, and technology choices. It covers system requirements, component design, and infrastructure planning.


## Sample Prompt

```
Design a scalable chat application system:
- Requirements: real-time messaging, 10M users, message persistence
- Components: API gateway, message service, user service, notification service
- Database: message storage, user data, session management
- Infrastructure: load balancing, caching, monitoring
- Scalability: horizontal scaling, data partitioning

Include architecture diagrams and technology choices.
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Requirements analysis** and capacity planning
- **High-level architecture** with component interactions
- **Database design** and data modeling
- **Scalability strategies** and performance optimization
- **Infrastructure components** and deployment considerations
- **Monitoring and observability** setup

## Best Practices

1. **Start with requirements** - Define functional and non-functional needs clearly
2. **Design for scale** - Plan for 10x growth from day one
3. **Use microservices judiciously** - Balance service boundaries with complexity
4. **Implement proper caching** - Multiple cache layers for different access patterns
5. **Plan for failures** - Design redundancy and graceful degradation
6. **Monitor everything** - Comprehensive logging, metrics, and alerting
7. **Automate deployments** - Infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipelines
8. **Security by design** - Authentication, authorization, and data protection

## When to Use This Template

- Designing new large-scale applications
- Planning system architecture for existing applications
- Preparing for technical interviews
- Creating architecture documentation
- Scaling existing systems
- Technology stack evaluation and selection
