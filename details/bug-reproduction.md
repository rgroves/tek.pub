This template helps you create reliable steps to reproduce bugs consistently, which is essential for effective debugging and testing. It includes environment setup, step-by-step procedures, and validation criteria.

## Sample Prompt

```
Create reproduction steps for a login authentication bug:
- Environment setup requirements (browser, OS, network conditions)
- Detailed step-by-step instructions to trigger the bug
- Expected vs actual behavior descriptions
- Screenshots or recordings of the issue
- Conditions that make the bug more or less likely to occur
- Minimal test case that demonstrates the problem
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Environment specification** including software versions, configurations, and dependencies
- **Step-by-step reproduction procedures** with clear, actionable instructions
- **Expected vs actual behavior** documentation with specific details
- **Test data requirements** and setup procedures
- **Timing and sequence considerations** for race conditions and timing-sensitive bugs
- **Variation testing** to understand the scope and conditions of the bug

## Best Practices

1. **Make steps as minimal as possible** while still reproducing the issue
2. **Include specific environment details** that may affect the bug
3. **Use precise language** and avoid ambiguous instructions
4. **Document timing requirements** for time-sensitive issues
5. **Include visual evidence** such as screenshots or recordings
6. **Test reproduction steps** with someone unfamiliar with the issue
7. **Note any workarounds** or conditions that prevent the bug
8. **Update reproduction steps** as you learn more about the issue

## When to Use This Template

- Reporting bugs to development teams
- Creating test cases for quality assurance
- Documenting issues for future reference
- Training team members on bug reporting
- Preparing for debugging sessions with clear reproduction steps
