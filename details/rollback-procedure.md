This template guides you through creating comprehensive rollback procedures for safe deployment recovery, including automated rollback triggers and manual intervention processes.

## Sample Prompt

```
Create rollback procedures for a microservices deployment:
- Automated health checks to trigger rollback on deployment failures
- Database migration rollback with data integrity preservation
- Load balancer configuration rollback for traffic routing
- Container orchestration rollback using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
- Feature flag-based rollback for gradual traffic shifting
- Communication plan for incident response and stakeholder notification
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Rollback automation** with health checks and failure detection mechanisms
- **Database rollback strategies** including migration reversal and backup restoration
- **Infrastructure rollback** for containerized and cloud-based deployments
- **Traffic management** during rollback procedures to minimize user impact
- **Monitoring and validation** to ensure successful rollback completion
- **Documentation and communication** for incident response and post-mortems

## Best Practices

1. **Test rollback procedures** regularly in non-production environments
2. **Implement automated health checks** to detect deployment issues quickly
3. **Use blue-green deployments** for instant rollback capabilities
4. **Maintain database backup strategies** with point-in-time recovery
5. **Document rollback triggers** and decision-making criteria clearly
6. **Practice incident response** with team training and simulations
7. **Monitor system health** during and after rollback procedures
8. **Conduct post-incident reviews** to improve rollback processes

## When to Use This Template

- Preparing deployment strategies with comprehensive rollback capabilities
- Responding to production incidents that require immediate system recovery
- Implementing continuous deployment with safe rollback mechanisms
- Planning disaster recovery procedures for critical system components
- Training teams on incident response and system recovery procedures
