This template guides you through implementing comprehensive logging strategies for applications, including structured logging, log aggregation, and monitoring integration.

## Sample Prompt

```
Implement logging for a microservices application:
- Structured logging with consistent format across services
- Request/response logging with correlation IDs for tracing
- Error logging with stack traces and contextual information
- Performance logging for slow queries and operations
- Security event logging for authentication and authorization
- Log aggregation setup with centralized monitoring dashboard
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Logging strategy** with appropriate log levels and message formatting
- **Structured logging** using JSON or other machine-readable formats
- **Correlation and tracing** for distributed system troubleshooting
- **Log aggregation** and centralized collection from multiple sources
- **Performance monitoring** through application and infrastructure metrics
- **Security logging** for audit trails and incident response

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate log levels** (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG) consistently
2. **Include correlation IDs** for tracing requests across services
3. **Log structured data** in JSON format for better searchability
4. **Avoid logging sensitive information** like passwords or personal data
5. **Implement log rotation** and retention policies for storage management
6. **Monitor log volume** and performance impact on applications
7. **Use centralized logging** for distributed system visibility
8. **Set up alerting** on critical error patterns and thresholds

## When to Use This Template

- Setting up logging infrastructure for new applications or services
- Improving observability in existing systems for better troubleshooting
- Implementing compliance requirements for audit logging
- Debugging production issues that require detailed system insights
- Monitoring application performance and user behavior patterns
