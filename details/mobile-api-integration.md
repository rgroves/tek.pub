This template guides you through integrating mobile applications with backend APIs, focusing on performance, offline capabilities, and mobile-specific considerations.

## Sample Prompt

```
Implement mobile API integration for a social media app:
- User authentication with token refresh and biometric support
- Feed API with pagination and offline caching strategies
- Image upload with compression and progress tracking
- Real-time notifications using push notifications and WebSockets
- Offline-first data synchronization for user-generated content
- Error handling and retry logic for unreliable network conditions
```

## What This Template Covers

- **API client architecture** optimized for mobile performance and reliability
- **Authentication strategies** including token management and biometric integration
- **Offline capabilities** with local data storage and synchronization
- **Performance optimization** including caching, compression, and lazy loading
- **Network handling** for varying connection quality and bandwidth
- **Security considerations** specific to mobile environments and data protection

## Best Practices

1. **Implement offline-first design** for better user experience
2. **Use efficient data formats** like Protocol Buffers or MessagePack
3. **Cache aggressively** with appropriate cache invalidation strategies
4. **Handle network errors gracefully** with user-friendly messaging
5. **Optimize for battery life** by minimizing background network activity
6. **Implement proper authentication** with secure token storage
7. **Use pagination** for large data sets to improve performance
8. **Test on real devices** with varying network conditions

## When to Use This Template

- Building mobile applications that consume REST or GraphQL APIs
- Implementing offline-capable mobile apps with data synchronization
- Optimizing mobile app performance for slow or unreliable networks
- Adding real-time features to mobile applications
- Securing mobile API communication and user data
