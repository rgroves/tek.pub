This template provides a systematic approach to upgrading dependencies safely while minimizing breaking changes and ensuring application stability. It covers assessment, testing, and rollback strategies.

## Sample Prompt

```
Plan a major dependency upgrade for a Node.js application:
- Audit current dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Identify breaking changes in major version upgrades
- Create upgrade strategy with incremental updates
- Test compatibility with existing codebase
- Update related configuration and documentation
- Plan rollback procedures in case of issues
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Dependency auditing** for security vulnerabilities and outdated packages
- **Breaking change assessment** and compatibility analysis
- **Upgrade strategy planning** with incremental and risk-based approaches
- **Testing procedures** to validate functionality after upgrades
- **Rollback planning** and contingency procedures for failed upgrades
- **Documentation updates** and team communication strategies

## Best Practices

1. **Audit dependencies regularly** for security and maintenance issues
2. **Test upgrades thoroughly** in development and staging environments
3. **Upgrade incrementally** rather than jumping multiple major versions
4. **Read release notes carefully** to understand breaking changes
5. **Maintain rollback capabilities** with version pinning and backup strategies
6. **Update documentation** and configuration files as needed
7. **Communicate changes** to team members and stakeholders
8. **Monitor post-upgrade** for issues and performance impacts

## When to Use This Template

- Performing regular dependency maintenance and updates
- Addressing security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Upgrading to major new versions with breaking changes
- Modernizing legacy applications with outdated dependencies
- Establishing dependency management processes for development teams
