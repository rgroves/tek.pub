This template helps you implement robust error handling strategies that improve application reliability and user experience. It covers validation, exception handling, logging, and graceful degradation patterns.

## Sample Prompt

```
Add comprehensive error handling to this user registration function:
- Input validation for email and password
- Exception catching for database operations
- Graceful degradation for external services
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging

[Provide your code here]
```


## What This Template Covers

- **Input validation** with comprehensive checking and sanitization
- **Exception handling** with try-catch blocks and error boundaries
- **Custom error classes** for different types of failures
- **Logging strategies** for debugging and monitoring
- **Graceful degradation** when services are unavailable
- **User-friendly messaging** that doesn't expose internal details

## Best Practices

1. **Create specific error types** for different failure scenarios
2. **Validate inputs early** and provide clear feedback
3. **Use try-catch blocks** around risky operations
4. **Log errors comprehensively** for debugging and monitoring
5. **Implement retry logic** for transient failures
6. **Gracefully degrade** when non-critical services fail
7. **Don't expose internal details** in user-facing error messages
8. **Use error boundaries** in React applications

## When to Use This Template

- Adding error handling to existing code
- Building robust APIs and services
- Implementing user input validation
- Creating fault-tolerant applications
- Setting up monitoring and logging
- Improving application reliability
