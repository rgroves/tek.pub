This template helps you implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices using tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible to manage infrastructure deployments with version control and automation.

## Sample Prompt

```
Create Infrastructure as Code for a web application deployment:
- VPC setup with public/private subnets and security groups
- Load balancer configuration with SSL termination
- Auto-scaling group for web servers with health checks
- RDS database setup with backup and monitoring
- CI/CD pipeline integration for infrastructure updates
- Environment separation (dev, staging, production)
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Infrastructure definition** using declarative configuration files and templates
- **Version control integration** for tracking infrastructure changes over time
- **Environment management** with parameterization and template reuse
- **Deployment automation** through CI/CD pipelines and orchestration tools
- **State management** and drift detection for infrastructure consistency
- **Security and compliance** considerations in infrastructure provisioning

## Best Practices

1. **Use version control** for all infrastructure configuration files
2. **Implement modular designs** with reusable components and templates
3. **Separate environments** clearly with different parameter files or workspaces
4. **Test infrastructure changes** in non-production environments first
5. **Implement proper state management** and backup procedures
6. **Use least privilege principles** for access control and permissions
7. **Monitor infrastructure drift** and implement automated remediation
8. **Document infrastructure architecture** and dependencies clearly

## When to Use This Template

- Implementing repeatable and consistent infrastructure deployments
- Managing multi-environment infrastructure configurations
- Automating infrastructure provisioning and updates
- Ensuring compliance and security in infrastructure management
- Scaling infrastructure operations for growing applications
