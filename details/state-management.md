This template guides you through implementing effective state management solutions for frontend applications, including global state, component state, and data synchronization patterns.

## Sample Prompt

```
Implement state management for a React dashboard application:
- Global user authentication state with persistent login
- Shopping cart state with local storage synchronization
- Real-time notifications state with WebSocket integration
- Form state management with validation and error handling
- API data caching with optimistic updates and error recovery
- Component state isolation for reusable UI components
```

## What This Template Covers

- **State architecture** including global, component, and derived state patterns
- **State persistence** with local storage and server synchronization
- **Performance optimization** through memoization and selective re-rendering
- **Asynchronous state** handling for API calls and real-time updates
- **State debugging** and development tools for troubleshooting
- **Testing strategies** for stateful components and state management logic

## Best Practices

1. **Choose appropriate state management** based on application complexity and team size
2. **Keep state normalized** to avoid duplication and synchronization issues
3. **Use immutable updates** to prevent unintended side effects
4. **Implement proper error boundaries** for state-related error handling
5. **Optimize re-renders** with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
6. **Separate concerns** between UI state and business logic state
7. **Use TypeScript** for better state type safety and developer experience
8. **Test state transitions** thoroughly with unit and integration tests

## When to Use This Template

- Building complex frontend applications with shared state requirements
- Implementing real-time features that require synchronized state updates
- Managing form state and validation across multiple components
- Optimizing application performance through better state management
- Creating reusable components that need isolated state management
