This template helps you create comprehensive Docker configurations that follow containerization best practices. It covers multi-stage builds, environment-specific configurations, and orchestration with Docker Compose.

## Sample Prompt

```
Create Docker configuration for a Node.js web application:
- Multi-stage build for production optimization
- Development and production environments
- Include database services (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Volume mounts for development
- Health checks and proper security practices
- Docker Compose setup with networking

Optimize for both development workflow and production deployment.
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Multi-stage Docker builds** for optimized production images
- **Development and production environments** with appropriate configurations
- **Service orchestration** with Docker Compose
- **Volume management** for data persistence and development workflows
- **Security best practices** including non-root users and minimal attack surface
- **Health checks and monitoring** for reliable container operations

## Best Practices

1. **Use multi-stage builds** to minimize production image size
2. **Run as non-root user** for security
3. **Implement health checks** for container monitoring
4. **Use .dockerignore** to exclude unnecessary files
5. **Pin specific image versions** for reproducible builds
6. **Configure proper logging** for debugging and monitoring
7. **Set resource limits** to prevent resource exhaustion
8. **Use secrets management** for sensitive data

## When to Use This Template

- Containerizing applications for deployment
- Setting up development environments with Docker
- Creating CI/CD pipelines with Docker builds
- Orchestrating multi-service applications
- Implementing microservices architecture
- Standardizing deployment across environments
