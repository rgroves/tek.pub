This template helps you design and implement scalable data processing pipelines for ETL operations, real-time streaming, and batch processing. It covers data ingestion, transformation, and output strategies.

## Sample Prompt

```
Design a data processing pipeline for customer analytics:
- Real-time event ingestion from web applications
- Data validation and cleansing procedures
- Transformation logic for aggregations and enrichment
- Storage in data warehouse for analytics queries
- Error handling and data quality monitoring
- Scalable architecture for high-volume data processing
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Data ingestion strategies** for batch and real-time data sources
- **Transformation logic** including validation, cleansing, and enrichment
- **Pipeline orchestration** with workflow management and scheduling
- **Error handling** and data quality monitoring procedures
- **Scalability design** for high-volume and high-velocity data processing
- **Monitoring and observability** for pipeline health and performance

## Best Practices

1. **Design for idempotency** to handle reprocessing and failures gracefully
2. **Implement comprehensive error handling** with proper logging and alerting
3. **Use schema validation** to catch data quality issues early
4. **Plan for scalability** with horizontal scaling and parallel processing
5. **Monitor data quality** with automated checks and quality metrics
6. **Implement proper backpressure handling** for streaming pipelines
7. **Use appropriate storage formats** optimized for your access patterns
8. **Document data lineage** for compliance and debugging purposes

## When to Use This Template

- Building ETL pipelines for data warehousing
- Implementing real-time data streaming and processing
- Creating data integration solutions between systems
- Processing large-scale batch data operations
- Setting up analytics and reporting data workflows
