This template helps you create modern React components following current best practices, including TypeScript integration, proper accessibility, and performance optimization. It ensures your components are maintainable, testable, and user-friendly.

## Sample Prompt

```
Create a React component for user registration form:
- Props interface: onSubmit, initialData, disabled, className
- State requirements: form data, validation errors
- Event handlers: input changes, form submission, validation
- Styling approach: CSS modules

Include TypeScript types and proper accessibility.
```

## What This Template Covers

- **TypeScript interfaces** for props and state
- **Accessibility (a11y) compliance** with proper ARIA attributes
- **Modern React patterns** including hooks and functional components
- **Performance optimization** with memoization and lazy loading
- **Testing considerations** with testable component structure
- **Styling approaches** for CSS modules, styled-components, or utility classes

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript** for better developer experience and fewer runtime errors
2. **Implement proper accessibility** with ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
3. **Keep components focused** on a single responsibility
4. **Use React.memo()** for expensive components that don't need frequent re-renders
5. **Implement error boundaries** for better error handling
6. **Write tests** for component behavior and user interactions
7. **Use consistent naming conventions** for props and state

## When to Use This Template

- Building new React components from scratch
- Refactoring existing components to modern standards
- Creating reusable component libraries
- Onboarding new team members to React best practices
- Implementing accessibility improvements
