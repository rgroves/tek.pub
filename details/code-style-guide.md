This template helps you establish consistent coding standards and style guidelines for development teams. It covers formatting, naming conventions, best practices, and automated enforcement strategies.

## Sample Prompt

```
Create a code style guide for a JavaScript/TypeScript project:
- Formatting rules: indentation, line length, spacing
- Naming conventions: variables, functions, classes, files
- Code organization: imports, exports, module structure
- Comment and documentation standards
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Git commit message format and branching strategy
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Formatting standards** including indentation, spacing, and line length guidelines
- **Naming conventions** for variables, functions, classes, and file organization
- **Code organization patterns** for imports, exports, and module structure
- **Documentation requirements** and comment formatting standards
- **Automated enforcement** using linters, formatters, and pre-commit hooks
- **Language-specific guidelines** and framework best practices

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize readability** over personal preferences in style decisions
2. **Use automated tools** to enforce style consistently across the codebase
3. **Document the reasoning** behind style decisions for team understanding
4. **Start with established standards** and customize as needed for your team
5. **Make style violations visible** in code reviews and CI/CD pipelines
6. **Keep the guide concise** and focus on the most impactful rules
7. **Update the guide regularly** based on team feedback and evolution
8. **Provide examples** of correct and incorrect code formatting

## When to Use This Template

- Establishing coding standards for new development teams
- Standardizing existing codebases with inconsistent formatting
- Onboarding new team members with clear style expectations
- Setting up automated code quality checks and enforcement
- Creating project-specific style guidelines for different languages
