This template helps you implement comprehensive backup and recovery strategies for databases, applications, and system data. It covers automated backup procedures, disaster recovery planning, and data restoration processes.

## Sample Prompt

```
Design a backup and recovery strategy for a PostgreSQL database:
- Automated daily backups with retention policy
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Cross-region backup replication
- Recovery testing procedures
- Monitoring and alerting for backup failures
- Documentation for recovery scenarios
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Automated backup scheduling** with configurable retention policies
- **Multiple backup types** including full, incremental, and differential backups
- **Cross-region replication** for disaster recovery
- **Point-in-time recovery** procedures and testing
- **Monitoring and alerting** for backup health and failures
- **Recovery documentation** with step-by-step procedures

## Best Practices

1. **Automate backup processes** to ensure consistency and reliability
2. **Test recovery procedures regularly** to validate backup integrity
3. **Implement multiple backup types** for different recovery scenarios
4. **Store backups in multiple locations** including off-site storage
5. **Monitor backup health** with alerts for failures
6. **Document recovery procedures** clearly for emergency situations
7. **Set appropriate retention policies** based on compliance requirements
8. **Encrypt sensitive backup data** both in transit and at rest

## When to Use This Template

- Setting up backup systems for production databases
- Implementing disaster recovery plans
- Meeting compliance requirements for data retention
- Migrating backup strategies to cloud platforms
- Creating automated backup monitoring systems
