This template helps you design and implement effective caching strategies to improve application performance and reduce resource usage. It covers different caching layers, invalidation strategies, and performance optimization techniques.

## Sample Prompt

```
Design a caching strategy for an e-commerce application:
- Multi-level caching (browser, CDN, application, database)
- Product catalog caching with inventory updates
- User session and shopping cart caching
- Cache invalidation strategies for price and inventory changes
- Performance monitoring and cache hit rate optimization
- Distributed caching for microservices architecture
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Multi-level caching architectures** from browser to database caching
- **Cache invalidation strategies** including TTL, event-driven, and manual invalidation
- **Distributed caching solutions** for scalable applications
- **Cache key design** and namespace management
- **Performance monitoring** and cache effectiveness metrics
- **Cache warming and preloading** strategies for optimal performance

## Best Practices

1. **Implement caching at multiple levels** for maximum performance benefit
2. **Design cache keys carefully** to avoid collisions and enable efficient invalidation
3. **Use appropriate TTL values** based on data volatility and freshness requirements
4. **Monitor cache hit rates** and performance metrics regularly
5. **Implement cache warming** for critical data and peak traffic periods
6. **Plan for cache failures** with graceful degradation strategies
7. **Consider cache coherence** in distributed systems
8. **Document caching policies** and invalidation strategies for the team

## When to Use This Template

- Optimizing application performance and response times
- Reducing database load and infrastructure costs
- Scaling applications for high traffic volumes
- Implementing caching in microservices architectures
- Designing content delivery and static asset caching strategies
