This template helps you implement secure authentication systems using modern best practices. It covers various authentication methods, security considerations, and implementation patterns for different types of applications.

## Sample Prompt

```
Implement JWT-based authentication system with:
- User registration and login endpoints
- Password validation and hashing
- JWT token generation with refresh tokens
- Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- OAuth integration with Google
- Multi-factor authentication support

Include security best practices and proper error handling.
```

## What This Template Covers

- **JWT token-based authentication** with refresh token rotation
- **OAuth 2.0 integration** with popular providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** implementation
- **Password security** with proper hashing and validation
- **Session management** and security headers
- **Rate limiting** and brute force protection

## Best Practices

1. **Use strong password policies** with minimum complexity requirements
2. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks
3. **Store passwords securely** using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
4. **Use JWT responsibly** with short expiration times and refresh token rotation
5. **Implement proper session management** with secure cookies
6. **Add security headers** (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
7. **Log authentication events** for security monitoring
8. **Regularly audit and update** dependencies for security vulnerabilities

## When to Use This Template

- Building user authentication for web applications
- Implementing secure API access controls
- Adding OAuth integration with third-party providers
- Upgrading existing authentication systems
- Meeting compliance requirements for user data security
