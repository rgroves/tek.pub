This template helps you design and implement comprehensive load testing strategies to evaluate application performance under various traffic conditions and identify bottlenecks.

## Sample Prompt

```
Create load testing for a web application:
- Simulate 1000 concurrent users with realistic user journeys
- Test API endpoints with varying request rates and payloads
- Monitor response times, throughput, and error rates
- Identify database and server resource bottlenecks
- Test auto-scaling behavior under increasing load
- Generate performance reports with actionable insights
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Load test planning** with realistic user scenarios and traffic patterns
- **Performance metrics** including response time, throughput, and resource utilization
- **Bottleneck identification** in application, database, and infrastructure layers
- **Scalability testing** for auto-scaling and capacity planning
- **Stress testing** to determine system breaking points and failure modes
- **Reporting and analysis** of performance test results and recommendations

## Best Practices

1. **Define realistic test scenarios** based on actual user behavior patterns
2. **Start with baseline performance** measurements before optimization
3. **Test in production-like environments** with similar data volumes
4. **Monitor system resources** including CPU, memory, and network usage
5. **Use gradual load increases** to identify performance degradation points
6. **Test different traffic patterns** including peak loads and sustained usage
7. **Include negative testing** for error handling under load
8. **Automate load tests** in CI/CD pipelines for regression detection

## When to Use This Template

- Preparing applications for production deployment or traffic increases
- Validating system performance after infrastructure or code changes
- Capacity planning for hardware sizing and scaling decisions
- Identifying performance bottlenecks before they impact users
- Testing system reliability and stability under sustained load
