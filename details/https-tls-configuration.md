This template helps you implement secure HTTPS/TLS configurations with proper certificate management, security headers, and best practices for web application security.

## Sample Prompt

```
Configure HTTPS/TLS for a production web application:
- SSL certificate procurement and installation
- TLS 1.3 configuration with secure cipher suites
- Security headers: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options
- Certificate auto-renewal with Let's Encrypt
- Load balancer and CDN SSL termination
- Security monitoring and vulnerability scanning
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Certificate management** including procurement, installation, and renewal processes
- **TLS configuration** with secure protocols, cipher suites, and security settings
- **Security headers** implementation for additional protection layers
- **Performance optimization** balancing security with connection speed
- **Monitoring and maintenance** for certificate expiration and security updates
- **Compliance considerations** for industry standards and regulatory requirements

## Best Practices

1. **Use TLS 1.3** or at minimum TLS 1.2 with secure cipher suites
2. **Implement HSTS** to enforce HTTPS connections and prevent downgrade attacks
3. **Set up automatic certificate renewal** to prevent expiration-related outages
4. **Use strong security headers** including CSP, X-Frame-Options, and others
5. **Monitor certificate expiration** with alerting and automated renewal
6. **Regularly update TLS configurations** to address new vulnerabilities
7. **Test SSL/TLS setup** with tools like SSL Labs for security validation
8. **Document configuration** for team knowledge and incident response

## When to Use This Template

- Securing web applications with HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Meeting security compliance requirements
- Implementing certificate management for production systems
- Optimizing SSL/TLS performance for high-traffic applications
- Setting up secure communication for API endpoints
