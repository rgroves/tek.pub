This template helps you design well-structured, maintainable classes following object-oriented design principles. It covers encapsulation, inheritance, composition, and design patterns for robust software architecture.

## Sample Prompt

```
Design a User class for an e-commerce application:
- Properties: id, email, profile, preferences, order history
- Methods: authentication, profile updates, password management
- Inheritance: extend from base Person class
- Composition: include Address and PaymentMethod objects
- Design patterns: implement Observer pattern for notifications
- Validation and error handling for all operations
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Object-oriented design principles** including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- **Design pattern implementation** for common software architecture problems
- **Class relationships** using composition, aggregation, and inheritance appropriately
- **Method design** with proper parameter handling and return types
- **Data validation** and error handling within class methods
- **Testing considerations** for unit testing and mock object creation

## Best Practices

1. **Follow single responsibility principle** with focused class purposes
2. **Use composition over inheritance** when appropriate for flexibility
3. **Implement proper encapsulation** with private/protected access modifiers
4. **Design for testability** with dependency injection and clear interfaces
5. **Handle errors gracefully** with appropriate exception handling
6. **Document class contracts** with clear method signatures and behavior
7. **Consider thread safety** for classes used in concurrent environments
8. **Apply design patterns judiciously** without over-engineering

## When to Use This Template

- Designing new classes and object hierarchies
- Refactoring existing code to improve structure
- Implementing design patterns in software architecture
- Creating reusable components and libraries
- Teaching object-oriented programming concepts
