This template helps you refactor code to improve maintainability, readability, performance, and testability while preserving existing functionality. It provides structured guidance for code improvements and migration strategies.

## Sample Prompt

```
Refactor this React component to improve:
- Maintainability: Extract custom hooks and separate concerns
- Readability: Better naming and documentation
- Performance: Optimize re-renders and memory usage
- Testability: Make components easier to unit test

Preserve existing functionality and provide migration notes.
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Code structure improvements** - Breaking down large functions and classes
- **Naming conventions** - Better variable, function, and class names
- **Performance optimizations** - Reducing complexity and improving efficiency
- **Separation of concerns** - Extracting reusable components and utilities
- **Error handling** - Adding proper validation and error management
- **Documentation** - Improving code comments and self-documenting code

## Best Practices

1. **Start small** - Focus on one area of improvement at a time
2. **Preserve functionality** - Ensure existing behavior remains unchanged
3. **Test before and after** - Have comprehensive tests before refactoring
4. **Follow SOLID principles** - Single responsibility, open/closed, etc.
5. **Improve naming** - Use clear, descriptive names for variables and functions
6. **Extract common patterns** - Create reusable functions and components
7. **Add documentation** - Include comments for complex logic
8. **Consider performance** - Optimize bottlenecks and resource usage

## When to Use This Template

- Improving legacy code quality
- Preparing code for new features
- Reducing technical debt
- Optimizing performance bottlenecks
- Making code more testable
- Standardizing coding patterns across teams
- Before major feature additions
- During code review improvements
