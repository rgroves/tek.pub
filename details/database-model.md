This template helps you design robust database models with proper entity relationships, data integrity constraints, and performance considerations. It covers conceptual, logical, and physical database modeling.

## Sample Prompt

```
Create a database model for a library management system:
- Entities: books, authors, members, loans, categories
- Relationships: many-to-many between books and authors, one-to-many for loans
- Constraints: unique ISBN, member limits, loan periods
- Indexes: search optimization for book titles and author names
- Normalization to 3NF while considering query performance
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Entity relationship design** with proper cardinality and participation constraints
- **Normalization strategies** balancing data integrity with query performance
- **Data integrity constraints** including primary keys, foreign keys, and business rules
- **Index design** for optimal query performance and data retrieval
- **Data type selection** and storage optimization considerations
- **Model documentation** with clear entity descriptions and relationship explanations

## Best Practices

1. **Start with conceptual modeling** before diving into implementation details
2. **Normalize appropriately** without over-engineering the design
3. **Define clear business rules** and implement them as database constraints
4. **Plan for scalability** with partitioning and indexing strategies
5. **Document relationships clearly** with proper cardinality notation
6. **Consider query patterns** when designing indexes and table structures
7. **Validate the model** with sample data and common query scenarios
8. **Review with stakeholders** to ensure business requirements are met

## When to Use This Template

- Designing database schemas for new applications
- Refactoring existing database structures
- Creating data models for specific business domains
- Planning database migrations and upgrades
- Teaching database design concepts and best practices
