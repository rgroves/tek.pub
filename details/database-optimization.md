This template helps you optimize database performance through query optimization, indexing strategies, and configuration tuning. It covers systematic approaches to identifying and resolving database performance bottlenecks.

## Sample Prompt

```
Optimize database performance for an e-commerce application:
- Analyze slow query logs and identify bottlenecks
- Design optimal indexes for frequently used queries
- Optimize complex JOIN operations and subqueries
- Configure database parameters for workload characteristics
- Implement query caching and connection pooling
- Monitor performance metrics and establish baselines
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Query optimization techniques** including index usage and execution plan analysis
- **Index design strategies** for different query patterns and workloads
- **Database configuration tuning** for optimal performance characteristics
- **Monitoring and profiling** tools and techniques for performance analysis
- **Caching strategies** at the database and application levels
- **Scaling considerations** including partitioning and replication strategies

## Best Practices

1. **Measure before optimizing** to establish performance baselines
2. **Focus on the biggest bottlenecks** rather than micro-optimizations
3. **Use appropriate indexes** without over-indexing and impacting writes
4. **Monitor query execution plans** to understand database optimizer decisions
5. **Consider workload characteristics** when tuning configuration parameters
6. **Test optimizations thoroughly** in staging environments before production
7. **Document changes** and their impact for future reference
8. **Implement continuous monitoring** to catch performance regressions early

## When to Use This Template

- Investigating slow database performance and bottlenecks
- Optimizing applications for high-traffic scenarios
- Preparing databases for scaling and growth
- Implementing performance monitoring and alerting
- Training team members on database optimization techniques
