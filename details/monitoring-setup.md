This template helps you establish comprehensive monitoring and observability for applications and infrastructure, including metrics collection, alerting, and dashboard creation.

## Sample Prompt

```
Set up monitoring for a web application:
- Application performance metrics including response times and error rates
- Infrastructure monitoring with CPU, memory, and disk usage alerts
- Database performance monitoring with query analysis
- Custom business metrics for user engagement and conversion tracking
- Log aggregation and analysis with search and filtering capabilities
- Alert configuration with escalation policies and notification channels
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Metrics collection** for application performance and business indicators
- **Infrastructure monitoring** including servers, containers, and cloud resources
- **Alerting strategies** with appropriate thresholds and escalation procedures
- **Dashboard design** for operational visibility and stakeholder reporting
- **Log management** with centralized collection and analysis tools
- **Distributed tracing** for understanding complex system interactions

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor the four golden signals** (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
2. **Set meaningful alert thresholds** based on historical data and SLAs
3. **Implement alert fatigue prevention** with proper grouping and suppression
4. **Use monitoring as code** for version control and reproducibility
5. **Create role-specific dashboards** for different team members and stakeholders
6. **Monitor both technical and business metrics** for comprehensive insights
7. **Implement proper alert escalation** with clear responsibility chains
8. **Regular review and tuning** of monitoring configuration and thresholds

## When to Use This Template

- Setting up monitoring for new applications or infrastructure
- Improving observability in existing systems for better incident response
- Implementing SLA monitoring and reporting for business requirements
- Adding proactive monitoring to prevent outages and performance issues
- Creating dashboards for operations teams and business stakeholders
