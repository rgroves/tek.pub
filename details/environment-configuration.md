This template helps you manage application configuration across different environments (development, staging, production) with proper security, flexibility, and maintainability practices.

## Sample Prompt

```
Set up environment configuration for a web application:
- Development, staging, and production environment configs
- Secure management of API keys and database credentials
- Environment-specific feature flags and settings
- Configuration validation and error handling
- Docker and Kubernetes configuration management
- CI/CD integration with environment promotion
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Multi-environment setup** with clear separation of concerns and settings
- **Secret management** for secure handling of sensitive configuration data
- **Configuration validation** to catch errors early in the deployment process
- **Environment promotion** strategies for moving configurations between environments
- **Container and orchestration** configuration for Docker and Kubernetes deployments
- **Monitoring and debugging** configuration issues across environments

## Best Practices

1. **Use environment variables** for configuration instead of hardcoded values
2. **Validate configuration** at application startup to catch issues early
3. **Keep secrets secure** with proper secret management tools and practices
4. **Document configuration options** with clear descriptions and examples
5. **Use configuration templates** for consistency across environments
6. **Version control configurations** while keeping secrets separate
7. **Test configuration changes** in staging before production deployment
8. **Implement configuration hot-reloading** where appropriate for operational flexibility

## When to Use This Template

- Setting up new applications with multiple deployment environments
- Improving configuration management for existing applications
- Implementing secure secret management practices
- Containerizing applications with environment-specific configurations
- Establishing configuration standards for development teams
