This template provides a systematic approach to investigating and diagnosing bugs in software applications. It includes debugging strategies, log analysis techniques, and root cause analysis methods.

## Sample Prompt

```
Investigate a bug where users are experiencing slow page load times:
- Analyze application logs for performance bottlenecks
- Check database query performance and indexing
- Review network requests and API response times
- Examine client-side JavaScript errors
- Identify potential memory leaks or resource issues
- Document findings and recommend fixes
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Systematic debugging approaches** with step-by-step investigation methods
- **Log analysis techniques** for identifying error patterns and performance issues
- **Performance profiling** to find bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Root cause analysis** methodologies for complex issues
- **Debugging tools and techniques** for different technology stacks
- **Documentation practices** for tracking investigation progress and findings

## Best Practices

1. **Reproduce the issue consistently** before starting investigation
2. **Gather comprehensive information** about the environment and conditions
3. **Use systematic debugging approaches** rather than random testing
4. **Document your investigation process** and findings thoroughly
5. **Leverage debugging tools** appropriate for your technology stack
6. **Analyze logs and metrics** to identify patterns and correlations
7. **Test hypotheses methodically** before implementing fixes
8. **Verify fixes resolve the issue** without introducing new problems

## When to Use This Template

- Investigating production bugs and performance issues
- Conducting post-mortem analysis of system failures
- Debugging complex application behavior
- Training team members on debugging methodologies
- Creating debugging runbooks for common issues
