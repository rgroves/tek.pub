This template helps you implement proven design patterns that solve common software architecture problems. It covers pattern selection, implementation strategies, and best practices for maintainable code.

## Sample Prompt

```
Implement the Observer pattern for a notification system:
- Subject interface for event publishers
- Observer interface for event subscribers
- Concrete implementations for email, SMS, and push notifications
- Thread-safe implementation for concurrent environments
- Event filtering and subscription management
- Example usage in user registration and order processing
```

## What This Template Covers

- **Pattern selection criteria** for choosing appropriate design patterns
- **Implementation strategies** with code examples and best practices
- **Common variations** and adaptations for specific use cases
- **Integration approaches** for combining multiple patterns effectively
- **Testing strategies** for pattern-based architectures
- **Performance considerations** and optimization techniques

## Best Practices

1. **Understand the problem first** before selecting a design pattern
2. **Don't force patterns** where simpler solutions would suffice
3. **Consider the trade-offs** between flexibility and complexity
4. **Document pattern usage** for team understanding and maintenance
5. **Test pattern implementations** thoroughly with edge cases
6. **Keep patterns simple** and avoid over-engineering solutions
7. **Consider language idioms** when implementing patterns
8. **Review with experienced developers** to validate pattern choice

## When to Use This Template

- Solving recurring design problems in software architecture
- Improving code maintainability and flexibility
- Teaching design patterns to development teams
- Refactoring legacy code with better architectural patterns
- Establishing coding standards and architectural guidelines
